# thumbnail-tool
 
I made this front end tool to make a quick 16:9 Youtube thumbnail from a 1:1 Event poster. This app purely written in HTML,CSS and Js

You can access this tool via https://saheenpalayi.github.io/thumbnail-tool/


## Future Goals 

 - add option to drag and drop image 
 - add option to paste image URL anywhere in the browser window 
 - add a feature to create multiple poster events based on the event dates
